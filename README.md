# Airline Reservation System

## Overview

The **Airline Reservation System** is a Java-based application that allows users to search for flights, make reservations, and view their reservation details. This system is designed to simulate a real-world airline booking process, providing an interface for managing flights, users, and reservations.

## Features

- **Search Flights:** Users can search for flights based on origin and destination.
- **Make Reservations:** Users can reserve seats on available flights using their passport number.
- **View Reservations:** Users can view their reservation details based on their passport number.
- **Database Integration:** The application connects to a MySQL database to store flight data, user information, and reservation details.
- **Dynamic Seat Management:** The system dynamically checks for available seats and ensures that seat numbers cannot be reused.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Main programming language for developing the application.
- **MySQL**: Database management system for storing and retrieving data.
- **JDBC**: Java Database Connectivity for connecting Java applications to the database.
